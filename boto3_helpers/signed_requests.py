    * *service* is the AWS API service code
    * *method* is an HTTP method like ``'GET'`` or ``'POST'``
    * *endpoint* is the target API endpoint. If you need to supply parameters, put
      supply them as a query string here (e.g., ``?MaxResults=1``)
    * *client* is a ``boto3.client`` instance for the same account and region as your
      target. If not given, is created with ``boto3.client('sts')``
    * *base_url* is the URL for the target AWS API. If not given, a guess will be made
      based on the service name and client region.
    * *operation_name* is the name of the API operation to use when signing the request

    If the API response indicates an error,
    ``boto3_helpers.signed_requests.SigV4RequestException`` will be raised.

    This function is useful for accessing endpoints that aren't supported by ``boto3``.
    For example, ``botocore`` introduced support for the ``'scheduler'`` service in
    version 1.29.7. You could have used this function to interact with that API
    before this new version was available:

    .. code-block:: python

        from boto3_helpers.signed_requests import sigv4_request

        schedule_data = sigv4_request('scheduler', 'GET', 'schedules')

    Explanation:

    * The EventBridge Scheduler API Reference describes the ``ListSchedules`` API
      action.
    * The service code for EventBridge Scheduler is ``'scheduler'``.
    * The method for ``ListSchedules`` is ``'GET'``.
    * The endpoint is ``'/schedules'``. This function will strip off leading slashes.

    We could haved optionally supplied the ``operation_name`` as ``'ListSchedules'``.
